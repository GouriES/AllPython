# Data-Structure & Algorithm in Python

You should know basic of Python before dive into Data Structure & Algorithm.

## Prerequisites
 - [Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables.asp)
 - [Data Types](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp)
 - [Conditional Loops](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp)
 - [Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)

## Types of Data-Structure

* [Primitive Data-Structure]()
* [Non-Primitive Data-Structure]()

### Primitive Data-Structure 
Primitive data structure is a kind of data structure that stores the data of only one type.
for example ([integer](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_numbers.asp), [float](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_numbers.asp), [string](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp), [Boolean](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_booleans.asp))

### Non-Primitive Data-Structure 
Non-primitive data structure is a type of data structure that can store the data of more than one type.
for example ([Array](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_arrays.asp), [Linked list](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linked-list-set-1-introduction/), [Stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-in-python/), [Queue](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-in-python/), [Graph](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-data-structure-and-algorithms/),[Binary Tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binarytree-module-in-python/), [Binary Search Tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-set-1-search-and-insertion/), [Heap](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/heap-queue-or-heapq-in-python/), [Hashing](https://tutorialspoint.com/python_data_structure/python_hash_table.htm))

## Algorithms 

* [Selection Sort]()
* [Insertion Sort]()
* [Bubble Sort]()
